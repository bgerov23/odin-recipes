    <h1> <strong> Odin's recipe </strong> </h1>

<ol>
<li>Worchester sauce</li>
<li>Beef bulion cubes</li>
<li>Sugar</li>
</ol>

<p>I have been loyal to this Meat Sauce recipe since I first learned to cook when I was a teenager. There are <em>3 little things</em> in this recipe that might be a bit different to Bolognese recipes you have seen around: </p>

<p> <strong>1. Worcestershire sauce:</strong> it just adds that little extra something-something. I get antsy if I get caught in a situation where I have to do without;</p>

<p> <strong>2. Beef bouillon cubes</strong> (beef stock cubes) for extra depth of flavour in the sauce, to compensate for this being an everyday midweek version rather than a traditional slow cooked Bolognese Ragu which starts with a soffrito (onion, celery, carrot slowly sautéed) as well as pancetta.</p>

<p><strong>3. Sugar,</strong>if needed: just a little bit goes a long way to <em>transform </em> the sauce if you happen not to be using high quality, sweet Italian canned tomatoes. Supermarket canned tomatoes here in Australia are notoriously sour. Especially the Australian ones,  it pains me so much to say that, but it is true. </p>

    <h2><strong>How to make Bolognese sauce</strong> </h2>

    <p>The making part is straightforward and quite quick too:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Saute garlic and onion – about 3 minutes;</li>
        <li>Brown the beef – about 2 minutes;
            <li>Add everything else, give it a good stir then simmer for 20 minutes minimum (midweek), up to 3 hours (weekend indulgence!). Slow cooking makes the beef incredibly tender and the sauce develops extra flavour.
</li>

    </ul>

<h3><em>The “proper” way to serve pasta: toss with the sauce</em></h3>
  
    <p>As with all my pasta recipes, I include a step to toss the pasta IN the sauce, rather than just placing pasta in bowls and spooning over sauce.</p>

    <p>This makes the Bolognese sauce emulsify, so it thickens, becomes glossy and clings to the spaghetti. <strong>No more watery sauce at the bottom of your pasta bowl!</strong> This is how chefs and Italians make pasta. Try it once, you will be converted!</p>

    <p>But it is an<strong>optional step.</strong>  Sometimes, you just don’t have the energy to clean yet another pan. I hear ya.</p>

    <h4><strong>What to serve with Spaghetti Bolognese</strong></h4>

    <p>For a classic Italian feast, serve this with:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Garlic Bread or even more indulgent, with Cheesy Garlic Bread (or go over-the-top with Crack Bread). Or, for a more traditional start, real-deal Italian Focaccia.</li>
        <li>Garden Salad with Italian Dressing (hit of crisp fresh salad essential!)</li>
        <li>Tiramisu to finish with an Espresso Martini on the side</li>
        
    </ul>

    <p>For a <strong>super quick side salad option</strong>, make this Rocket Parmesan Salad with Balsamic Dressing. Probably my most made side salad because it’s literally a 2 minute effortless-no-chop salad!</p>
